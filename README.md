# My MiniSoundsChallenge 2023
My 2023 mini sounds challenge while I work in BBC Sounds Mobile.

This challenge takes place in four stages which are in place to help guide a new starter through understanding the basics of how the BBC sounds app works.

This app is very basic as it's my first ever swift application and I'm using this repo to document how I've been getting on with it!
